<p>
For my visualization, I chose to model the Fernanda Viegas and Martin Wattenberg's visualization by presenting the data in the form of a stream graph. This allowed the visualization to have a similar structure and overview their example. I then took the stream graph and modified it to be circular have similar form, but yet to improve the design and artistic value.  I chose "cardinal-closed" to draw the paths because it gave the visualization a more artistic and natural look. I then changed the colors to be a range of colors from yellow to red. 
</p>
<p>
The visualization randomizes these colors to change up which data stands out the most while also being a dynamic piece of art.  Although the colors change, the position of each layer stays the same. Each layer represents a different category of energy consumption. I chose the color range so that it has significance to what the data shows, but yet is still finalistic. The colors are those typical of fire, which to many people is directly related to energy. My visualization shows the energy consumption like a ball of fire.

The fact that one can change the colors also shows the mood in which the energy was consumed. For instance, one's energy consumption varies, but how one uses the energy also varies. A person can cycle through the color combination that represents their preference. This allows the mood in which one consumes energy to be mapped to the actual data since the user can only alter the colors, not the layers. The only way one can alter the layers is by their actual consumption. This allows one to interact with the art to reflect both personal changes and behavioral changes in one overview. This serves to provide a dashboard to see energy consumption and environment mood in a dynamic piece of art that is as calming and ambient as a fireplace.
